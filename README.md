# starship_PvP

Computer Game based on the classic game Space Invaders with expanded features.

This project was started in large part to gain further experience implementing object oriented software design patterns.

Currently developing as I work through this book: http://www.gameprogrammingpatterns.com/

All code is being developed to run on a Raspberry Pi or Linux environment using PyGame.

The primary game code is written in Python.

Future development includes building two USB game controllers that will interface with the Raspberry Pi with firmware written in C++.
